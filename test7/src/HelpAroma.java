/* Problem statement
Teaching Assistants at Coding Ninjas are working day and night for resolving doubts of students. On a particular day, Aroma had solved lot of doubts. There is still one left unsolved, so, she is asking for help.

The description of the doubt is - "Help me solve this question."

The question is described as - "You are given a word M and K queries. In every query, there are four integers: W, X, Y and Z. Let us form another word P by the characters at positions: [W, X] of a given word M (characters at position W and X are inclusive). Let us form another word Q by the characters at positions [Y, Z] of the given word M (characters at positions Y and Z are inclusive). For every query, you must answer if it is possible to rearrange the letters of word Q and form word P."

Your task is to help Aroma and write code for this problem.

Detailed explanation ( Input/output format, Notes, Images )
Input Format:
The first line of input contains the string M. The length of string M lies in the range: [1, 50000]. String M consists only of lowercase letters of English alphabet. The second line of input contains an integer, that denotes the value of K (1 <= K <= 50000). Each of the following K lines contains four integers: W, X, Y, Z. (1 <= W, X <= |M| and 1 <= Y, Z <= |M|).
Constraints:
Time Limit: 1 second
Output Format:
There are K lines of output, one for each query. For each query, print "true" if it possible and "false" otherwise.   
Sample Input 1:
navdeepdvan
2
1 4 8 11
4 5 7 8
Sample Output 1:
true
false
Explanation:
In the first query, the word formed are: P is "navd" and Q is "dvan". Hence, true.
In the second query, the word formed are: P is "de" and Q is "pd". Hence, false. */
